Financial Fraud Analysis Using Power BI
📊 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing financial transaction data to identify fraudulent activities using Power BI. It includes a full workflow: data exploration and preprocessing in Python, followed by interactive dashboards in Power BI.
The main goal is to uncover fraud patterns, visualize insights, and support data-driven decision-making.
